# Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## Project Overview

With the surge in online transactions, credit card fraud has become a significant concern, costing billions of dollars annually and affecting both consumers and businesses. Effective fraud detection systems are crucial to shield clients from monetary losses and unauthorized transactions while reducing the risk of default.

This project leverages machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent activities in credit card transactions. By analyzing large datasets, it identifies fraud patterns, enabling early detection and prevention. The focus is on building a reliable system that mitigates fraud and enhances trust in financial systems.

This project stands out due to its meticulous approach to feature selection and model optimization. From an extensive dataset containing 120 features, we conducted a detailed analysis to identify the most relevant attributes, streamlining the data for efficient processing and reducing noise. Unlike many standard implementations, we explored and compared a variety of machine learning algorithms to determine the best fit for the task. Most notably, by applying advanced hyperparameter tuning techniques, we achieved a remarkable accuracy improvement from 88.26% to 98.37%. This significant enhancement is critical given the financial implications of the problem, where even minor inaccuracies can lead to substantial monetary losses and compromised trust. This project exemplifies a thoughtful, data-driven approach to solving real-world challenges in fraud detection.
