The "Credit Card Fraud Detection System" project uses advanced machine learning algorithms to address rising credit card fraud. Algorithms like Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost were evaluated, with Random Forest proving the most accurate. The system employs data analysis and pattern recognition to detect fraud, crucial for industries like banking and e-commerce. Feature extraction and correlation matrices optimize model performance. Achieving over 90% accuracy, the model is serialized with Python's Pickle and deployed via Flask, featuring a user-friendly interface for visualizing credit card defaulters' data.

Step 1: Initialize all the dependencies and library

Step 2: Download the model.pickle file with the help of downloadModel.py (This step is necessary as git has a single file 2GB limit.)

Step 3: Set up Flask app and start the web server.
